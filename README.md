# Trust-Aware-Agentic-Autonomy
A human centered agentic AI prototype that studies how autonomous systems should decide when to act, when to ask, and how much control to take based on user trust and emotional context. The project focuses on autonomy calibration, explainable decisions, and human-in-the-loop interaction rather than task optimization.
